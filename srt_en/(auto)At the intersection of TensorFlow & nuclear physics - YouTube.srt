[Music]

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,680
hi everybody I'm Laurence Moroney I'm

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,849
reporting here from the tensorflow

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,070
summit we're in the tensorflow cafe and

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,750
it's a great pleasure to be chatting

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,519
with Ian Lang Moore who's a software

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,130
engineer and he works with tensorflow in

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,420
nuclear physics

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,090
Ian welcome hey well thanks for having

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,920
me on so tell us all about it what do

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,449
you do there's a goal of powering of

12
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,220
getting power from nuclear fusion right

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,859
so it's incredibly energy dense what you

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,989
do is you take maybe I can borrow a

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,390
couple of these coffee grinds you put

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,629
together two small nuclei okay and what

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,309
you get out weighs a little bit less

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,500
than what you put in and the remainder

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,020
is a huge amount of energy right so it's

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,260
the conversion of mass to energy and it

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,360
equals MC squared exactly yeah

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,570
and so it's so incredibly energy dense

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,570
that to provide the power that humanity

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,949
would need over the next hundred years

25
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,300
we require say the boron that the world

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,460
currently produces for just seven months

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,710
so say hey set aside the next seven

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,210
months of boron and we have enough

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,100
energy for the next hundred years and no

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,409
greenhouse gas emissions that would be

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,689
nice that would be nice and it's also

32
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,670
challenging so obviously anything that

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,770
has that high of a payoff people have

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,689
been trying and they've been trying for

35
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,020
about 70 years and what happens is the

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,740
plasma gets unstable so the reaction

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,900
happens inside of this plasma which is

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,979
say a swarm of charged particles and ten

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,640
million degrees or hotter and they don't

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,380
want to stay in place

41
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,299
right so they get excited at that

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,759
temperature yeah things get a little hot

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,009
they want to get out and what happens is

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,950
things become unstable they get out and

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,479
then it cools down and the reaction

46
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,540
stops and we end up putting in more

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,850
energy just to keep the reaction going

48
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,439
can we get out and that's what's been

49
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,719
happening for 70 years Wow okay so

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
there's this company

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,030
Foothill Ranch ta technologies that is

52
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,940
now on their fifth generation plasma

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,650
generator okay we've been working with

54
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,990
them since 2015 to try to accelerate

55
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,900
progress so it's this ends up being this

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,820
gigantic machine it's like think of this

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,430
long cigar where there's a hot plasma in

58
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,160
the middle okay and the goal is to use

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,860
the magnets and neutral beams and all

60
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,300
these other technologies to keep that

61
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,040
plasma confined so this is an

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,080
experimental reactor it's I mean it's

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,470
it's not the fusion reaction it's not

64
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,880
what's happening what's your hat what's

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,950
happening here is you're seeing how can

66
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,290
tightly can we can find this plasma as

67
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,860
we ramp up the temperature and so

68
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,420
they're doing experiments every 20

69
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,400
minutes and then every 20 minutes they

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,360
push down data we pull it in and we give

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,120
back a three-dimensional image of what

72
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,420
their plasma looks like okay nice you

73
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,800
might think well why can't I just look

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,740
at the plasma you know and the point is

75
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,130
first of all it's well it's very thin

76
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,860
and it's incredibly hot and you know you

77
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,690
can consider like why can't I just look

78
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,209
at a light bulb and tell you what's

79
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,410
inside of it well you only have a

80
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,090
two-dimensional view you're on the

81
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,590
boundary you get a two-dimensional view

82
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,600
of what goes on but you want to look at

83
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,820
a three-dimensional object right and

84
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,010
moreover it's so hot that you can only

85
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,870
have a limited number of views into it

86
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,820
so what you end up with things are like

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,950
you shine 14 lasers through the center

88
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,810
and you measure the phase shift of those

89
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,000
lasers okay and this gives you the

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,700
density along each of the lines but from

91
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
that you want to reconstruct the density

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,840
everywhere so it's a very under

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,820
determined problem so I've gone on for a

94
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,640
little no this is great so it's helping

95
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,380
clarify it for me hopefully for you too

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,170
and so but the idea then is that so this

97
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,989
distribution reactor every 20 minutes

98
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,760
you're doing an experiment you're

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,920
pulling that into code that you've

100
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,930
written intensive

101
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,030
and then that code is generating a 3d

102
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,610
image right yeah now that's not the

103
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,829
typical use of tentacle no no not at all

104
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,900
so this really isn't deep learning this

105
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,430
is an inverse problem this is great

106
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,930
though so it just shows the flexibility

107
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,730
of the classroom yeah a real key

108
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,500
difference is and deep learning often

109
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,350
you have many many many examples you

110
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,180
have many many labels so you have the

111
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,800
input output and you can learn a very

112
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,860
complex functional relationship so here

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,990
we actually don't have the labels that

114
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,729
the labels would be this is what the

115
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,590
actual plasma looks like but we're the

116
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,000
ones telling people what the plasma

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,010
looks like we don't have those we do

118
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,020
have a precise model for how the

119
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,280
measurement works and so from that it's

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,620
an even way think the naive thing would

121
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,500
be just to invert the equation so if

122
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,630
this is what the plasma was this is what

123
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,979
the measurement is well if we know the

124
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,180
measurement let's invert the equation

125
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,220
you get the plasma problem is it's

126
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,349
there's many plasmas that could have

127
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,599
given the same measurement so we're

128
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,130
gonna give them a distribution over

129
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,620
possible plasmas so doing a Bayesian

130
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,380
inverse problem okay and our graph is

131
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,599
modeling the measurement physics and

132
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,750
some physical assumptions rather than an

133
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,090
arbitrary function so then the output of

134
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,860
this does it become a situation where

135
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,229
because of running experiment every 20

136
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,990
minutes that they can now optimize their

137
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,150
future experiments based on the results

138
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,680
that you're giving them yeah well they

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
can understand their experiments based

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,620
on these results there's actually a

141
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,810
coincident effort by Googlers to help

142
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,720
optimize experimental design and there

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,449
was a paper published in that Ted bolts

144
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,510
is was one of the names Michael Ducati

145
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,430
well we'll put a link to the paper in

146
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,050
description so then people can go read

147
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,240
it for themselves so fascinating stuff

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,470
and it's like how did you get involved

149
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,979
in this well so I have been at Google

150
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:53,919
for about four years and I was looking

151
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,599
around internally for teams that were

152
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,430
doing something with reducing greenhouse

153
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,400
gas emissions

154
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,199
and so then this popped up and I was

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,760
like oh this is great and then it's an

156
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,620
inverse problem which is what I did for

157
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,160
my PhD and my pulse talk so it's like

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,990
okay this is like a perfect fit so when

159
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,910
I started working with them nice is your

160
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,030
row like coding the way yeah yeah so I

161
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,669
wrote is writing a code and also coming

162
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,860
up with the statistical models so I've

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,510
been writing code specific for our team

164
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,880
and then also the same time they were

165
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
writing code for the tensor flow

166
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,030
distributions and tensor flow

167
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,880
probability libraries so these are sort

168
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,740
of form the core building blocks like we

169
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,440
have a normal distribution object or a

170
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,389
Laplace distribution and so on and so

171
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,000
forth and these are you know it's an

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,860
object that allows you to you can

173
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,870
produce samples you can get a PDF and so

174
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,780
on and then we have a method or

175
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,790
transforming one distribution to another

176
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,139
with this thing called the by chapter

177
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,139
yep yep so we we actually did an episode

178
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,820
of coffee with a Googler on the

179
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,669
distribution API which is like yeah so

180
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,560
check it out on the Google developers

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,270
Channel it was assuming it was

182
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,979
mind-bending because of just the kind of

183
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,440
things that it offers to you as an API

184
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
