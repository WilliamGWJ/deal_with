2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,379
hi everybody and welcome to the

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,360
tensorflow developer summit we're right

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,950
here in the tensorflow cafe and I'm

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,080
chatting with Sandeep who's a product

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,360
manager on tensorflow itself and Sandee

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,699
thanks for coming Thank You Don and

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,590
really really excited to be here are you

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,300
enjoying the summit so far oh this has

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,070
been incredibly exciting I mean I think

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,320
you know to see all the people the users

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,880
that we have here we turned out here in

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,250
person to listen to their stories what

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,560
they're doing see all the cool work see

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,690
the interest and and the following of

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,170
tensorflow

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,940
and not just here in the room but with

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,590
all of our you know livestream viewers

19
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,420
and the global viewing parties and all

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,520
that it's it's been really really good

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,170
to see all this and it's very motivating

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,300
it's like this is a product that you're

23
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,100
working on and just the sheer excitement

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,750
that's out there about it it's like yeah

25
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,879
maybe the ideas the creativity I think

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,399
it's just just amazing where we are in

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,629
the field of machine learning as a whole

28
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,789
and the roller tensorflow is playing in

29
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,530
that sometimes I just have to pinch

30
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,260
myself yes yes absolutely yeah so one of

31
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,399
the things we saw in the keynote was

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,589
just how quickly tensorflow is growing

33
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,970
and the trajectory that it's not on

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,280
there was that what you expected no I

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,510
don't think I don't think any of us

36
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,220
expected that or anticipated that right

37
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,950
I think it's mean it's you know the way

38
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,939
machine learning is sort of

39
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,259
transitioning in the society right now

40
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,320
from not just playing a role in research

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,939
and sort of very advanced scientific

42
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,740
discovery type of things but beginning

43
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,090
to make a difference in so many

44
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,310
different areas and I'm think we've seen

45
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,020
that in our in our user community right

46
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,829
it's the just the the explosive growth

47
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,750
and the number of people and I think

48
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,240
it's a testament to the this incredibly

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,490
powerful platform that our engineering

50
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,920
teams have built which is you know so

51
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,100
flexible and can address these really

52
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,049
really fundamental problems and then our

53
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,700
focus and making it easier to use and

54
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,590
opening up a lot of new applications and

55
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,479
then how the community has also gotten

56
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,220
involved and like just checks so much

57
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,960
stuff in and contributed so much that's

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
been a big part of it and I think that

59
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,110
is that has really helped with our

60
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,210
partners with our collaborators and how

61
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,430
they have contributed and helped sort of

62
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,020
open up doors to a lot of applications

63
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,979
that we wouldn't have thought about

64
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,439
ourselves so yeah I think it's it's just

65
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,530
it's just a great place to be at the

66
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,330
and some of the scenarios that we've

67
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,040
seen right it's just like it's it's all

68
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
inspiring like finding planets yeah yeah

69
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
yeah and the cassava story we saw

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,830
earlier today right I mean I think just

71
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,540
all these all these applications that

72
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,510
touching upon all aspects of human life

73
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,180
I think it's just that's that's the best

74
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,610
part about this it's a beautiful thing

75
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,110
so you know when we're seeing this

76
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,700
trajectory of growth in like you know

77
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,890
but now just a pivot to the future a

78
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,940
little bit like you know from a

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,340
developer perspective it's I find it's

80
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,600
just really beautiful to see new

81
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,120
programming language is it yes yes yeah

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,070
and that has been a big sort of focus

83
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,850
for us to make the platform be supported

84
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,250
on in languages and in environments that

85
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,530
that our users are at and so today we

86
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,660
announced support for Swift in fact the

87
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,750
talkback listener is later today and

88
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,700
JavaScript and I'm super excited about

89
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,680
that because you know JavaScript as we

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,239
know is the number one language

91
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,790
programming language with a huge web

92
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,580
developer community that's out there

93
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,600
traditionally you know what we have seen

94
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,190
is that machine learning has been sort

95
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,690
of a little bit more in the in the

96
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,070
Python world and so on

97
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,110
I think this opens up the doors for all

98
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,510
of the web developers to try to zoom

99
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,489
just easily incorporate machine learning

100
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,340
into their applications they can use all

101
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,530
kinds of sensors that are very well

102
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,360
connected into the browser world and

103
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,489
develop some really nice interactive

104
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,290
things and we have some amazing demos

105
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,700
here that that users are seen pac-man is

106
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,769
fun I can't wait to get home and try it

107
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,950
and I beat my son with it yes I could

108
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,530
probably go faster like that yeah and

109
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,720
this is all done in JavaScript that's

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,459
right exactly so I think what javascript

111
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,220
will allow us to do really is that one

112
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,400
sort of it works in the browser and it's

113
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,010
sort of there's really nothing no

114
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,390
heavy-duty installations or anything

115
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,519
like that it's very quick and to get

116
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,560
something up and running we can take

117
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,329
previously train models and with the

118
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,769
type of converters that we are making a

119
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:04,850
little available through this library

120
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,110
it's going to be very easy to bring in

121
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,190
models that have been previously trained

122
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,870
another data and then retrain them and

123
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,850
then apply them to your applications and

124
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,220
in addition to that you can also train

125
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,440
in the browser that's yes exactly yes

126
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,510
which is just mind-blowing yes so it is

127
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,070
it is yeah it is a full fledge training

128
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,080
environment and you can build very cool

129
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,540
interactive applications by doing this

130
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,670
yes I remember my very first JavaScript

131
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,110
program was like to put an alert box

132
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,520
when somebody used the right mouse

133
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,980
button yes yes I think we've all written

134
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,900
one of them yeah yeah and now to think

135
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,250
that that language can be used not just

136
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,840
for training but also for inferences

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,030
then yes yes yes and the other thing you

138
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,240
can do is I mean there is this deep

139
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,590
learning playground which is available

140
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,320
on the learn with Google site and that's

141
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,150
another way that JavaScript allows you

142
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,130
to sort of visualize these things in a

143
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,660
such an interactive way that I think it

144
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,640
will drive an ability to understand

145
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,530
these models and really sort of iterate

146
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,270
faster and come up with working

147
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,770
solutions so if you don't want to learn

148
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,540
Python and you're already a JavaScript

149
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,250
developer you know just thinking about

150
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,750
it from a career perspective that your

151
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,310
JavaScript skills have taken on a whole

152
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,420
new meaning yes yes yes start so if I am

153
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,040
a JavaScript developer and I want to

154
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
take advantage of this yes how what

155
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,950
would you recommend to get started you

156
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,960
mentioned that playground yes yeah yeah

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
so I think you know there are a lot of

158
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
resources available so specifically for

159
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,790
JavaScript what we are launching today

160
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,900
is a new website JSON support and that

161
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,419
website has a very nice getting started

162
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,370
section which has some step-by-step

163
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,290
tutorials that it walks you through and

164
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,180
some quick examples of some curve

165
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,700
fitting and regression and image

166
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,470
classification that you can get up and

167
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,630
running in your browser so that's an

168
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,260
excellent way to start and I think as we

169
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,210
go forward we will sort of continuously

170
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,950
make more and more of these types of

171
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,930
applications that people want to do and

172
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,370
make them available in this in this

173
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,780
platform is pac-man gonna be there

174
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,520
pac-man demo is already there actually

175
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,200
so you can you can clone that and you

176
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,850
can sort of mess around with it maybe

177
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,560
get two people to simultaneously drive

178
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,060
it but you can do some very fun things

179
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm thinking of an April Fool's prank

180
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,020
where I train the left arrow to be right

181
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,850
and the up arrow to be down and see if I

182
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
can get people to be back yeah that'll

183
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:10,890
be fun

184
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,990
don't tell anybody it's just everybody

185
