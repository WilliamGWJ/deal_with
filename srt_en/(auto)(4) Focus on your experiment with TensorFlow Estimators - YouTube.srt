00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,010
hi everybody and welcome to the tense

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,510
flow developer summit I'm Laurence

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,799
Moroney and I'm here at the tensorflow

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,779
cafe and it's my great honor to speak

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,130
with Mustafa sp

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,170
you just did a talk at the summit on

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,150
estimators and hiking and lots of

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,009
different things and you know I was part

9
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,660
of the rehearsals for his talk and I

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,550
could chat with him for hours about this

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,340
stuff but we've only got a few minutes

12
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,369
so that's good we have a couple so I

13
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,630
just like to ask about some of the

14
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,670
highlights you're hiking scenario could

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,470
you tell us about that first so you know

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,940
I want to make it an example so that a

17
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,489
practitioner can understand or feel I've

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,059
come all of these api's fit well in the

19
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,890
journey of machine learning and I do

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,480
like that you think of a machine

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,890
learning as a journey not a destination

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,590
yeah it's a journey it's never-ending

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,440
journey and it's an exciting journey and

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,449
the focus of your talk was really about

25
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,550
estimators and about pre-made estimators

26
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,250
pyramid estimators tell us how to

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,969
combine these two these things I think

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,920
the main lion can be summarized as

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
experimenting your ideas we take couple

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,670
of lines of code so how can you do that

31
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,080
experiment with your ideas with only a

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,820
couple of lines of code I like that so

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,409
and one of the things you also shared

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,880
was just how much estimators are

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,340
actually used hearing yeah it's you know

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,490
I personally I'm surprised to today

37
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,240
wow it's so popular here and it's and I

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,020
personally have some of the projects to

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,759
use these estimators and learn from them

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,579
and the feedback we got from all of

41
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,590
these different use cases it really

42
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,700
helped us like we see their pain or they

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,640
are trying to do this but now this

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
partitioning is not going well so that's

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,460
why the training is so slow

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,740
so how can we fix it to be so all those

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,210
things or like I worked on the on a team

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,920
where we were using machine learning

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,219
before to improve a product and at that

50
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,850
time I realized experimenting with

51
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,799
features is the one of the most

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,140
important thing right so that's why we

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,570
all the pathology experience under the

54
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,310
APS

55
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,780
right because it one of the things in

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,950
your talk is you were talking about

57
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,989
feature columns and proper use of

58
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,280
feature columns could help reduce your

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,810
lines of code could you give us an

60
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,090
example so yeah that's the thing I

61
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,370
mentioned in that project then I wasn't

62
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,580
there so like what they always have

63
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,680
ideas about features oh how can I use

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,840
this feature for example this hiking

65
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,340
example let's think about how you

66
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,209
example

67
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,780
oh I I can use the zip code of user

68
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,510
lifting providing that website right so

69
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,030
I'm can use that like let's make it easy

70
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,560
so that's kind of stuff we work on right

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,630
now as well as machine learning we

72
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,860
always think of like this you can have

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,170
trees for decisions as well yeah you

74
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,940
introduced this concept of gradient

75
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,160
boosted trees yeah which I want a

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,380
t-shirt without my other estimator is a

77
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,739
gradient boosted tree could you tell us

78
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,019
about them whatever we got a lot of

79
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,620
requests like and based on the survey

80
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,150
take a survey like this is really

81
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,970
popular and for example is stable it's

82
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,459
not random like it wasn't like one

83
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,130
bunting with tip learning every time we

84
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,930
trended the model you may get a

85
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,959
different model because of the random

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,459
civilizational but the scene trees are

87
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,130
always provide you the same so you can

88
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,109
so there are a bunch of good stuff with

89
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,540
that so we worked hard create this

90
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,019
pyramid estimator so that it should not

91
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,299
be difficult for people if they want to

92
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,170
experiment with no network or trees but

93
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,000
if you don't have pyramid estimator you

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,370
need to switch to another pipeline you

95
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,780
need to create another input function

96
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,630
like so that's messed up so we are

97
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,400
solving that hopefully it sounds good

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm looking forward to trying them out I

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,850
do it's one of the things that it's on

100
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,120
my very long to do this and but like you

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
say it just works hopefully

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,590
I think use that phrase several times

103
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,530
but I also said it may ever I mean you

104
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,540
need to experiment so we don't know I

105
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,520
feel like fermentation you don't know

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,710
which one really fits well into your

107
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,850
problem so there's a quote from Peter

108
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,610
Norvig he was saying very famous kid oh

109
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,240
yeah he's he's saying machine learning

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,940
changes are like how we look at the

111
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,770
engineering because normally you build

112
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,210
something based on the mathematical

113
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,670
rules and you provide that as a solution

114
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,710
but in this case it's becoming more

115
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,140
natural science so you need to

116
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,890
experiment to understand and you need to

117
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,750
analyze the output based on the

118
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,390
statistical thinking so it is different

119
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,140
than like hey this will work for you and

120
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm adding this thing and it will work

121
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,440
for you no we cannot say you need to

122
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,450
experiment right okay so becoming more

123
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,010
more scientific right experiment

124
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,230
evaluate the results form a hypothesis

125
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,790
and then you test the hypothesis in the

126
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,180
experiment again alright so switching

127
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,470
gears for a second one of the things

128
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,210
that you also talking about that really

129
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,500
intrigued me and I still need to get my

130
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,600
head around is transfer learning well

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,220
you can take like the learning from one

132
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,169
graph and it effectively chocolate

133
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,669
changer to transfer to another this

134
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,410
surprising that that is simple and works

135
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,200
so you can't like this is it it just

136
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:30,540
works so at the first time I was really

137
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,580
surprised to know I'm copying all these

138
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,470
variables from here to there and it

139
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,650
works how come so then I realized that

140
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,620
network learns a transformation but if

141
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,480
you think layer by layer transformation

142
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
and and we are leveraging that those

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,510
transformations in my other network and

144
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,970
my other network because of retraining

145
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,320
on top of it as an advantage of can

146
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,280
decide how can they how can it uses the

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,870
transformation or not like whether it

148
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,900
helps or not so it can it has a room to

149
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,940
the south that's

150
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,640
pretty : it's just the possibilities of

151
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,220
like some experts in one area being able

152
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,840
to train a model and experts in another

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,640
area being able to train a different

154
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,290
model and in chopping changes transfer

155
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,050
yeah I also like give a big shout to TF

156
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,450
hub so they make it one line like that

157
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,700
with the one line you are accessing one

158
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,420
of the best model trained in Google this

159
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,550
that's so powerful it only seems too

160
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,820
good to be true yes if I want to take

161
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,320
advantage of this and I want things to

162
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,600
just work for me what recommendation

163
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,730
would hopefully recommendation would you

164
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,800
give me to get started with the transfer

165
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,750
learning transfer learning gradient

166
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,970
boosted trees estimators all of these

167
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,120
things so we are putting examples under

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,250
we called module garden or official

169
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,480
model examples at github and github so

170
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,310
you can start with those examples

171
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,910
because an example as data and some

172
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,890
training parameters so when you start

173
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,190
with that example then you can put your

174
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,350
own data into it slow by slow so I think

175
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,150
starting with an example is the best way

176
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,950
to so take a look at those in the models

177
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,100
garden yes I like that but outside is I

178
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,980
think the official models yeah so much

179
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,930
nicer and you can have some gradient

180
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,700
boosted trees in your garden yes and

181
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,370
yeah it's not out there yet the example

182
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,660
but we are adding the example that

183
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,790
sounds good well thank you so much my

184
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,770
staff at this is Ben

185
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,740
