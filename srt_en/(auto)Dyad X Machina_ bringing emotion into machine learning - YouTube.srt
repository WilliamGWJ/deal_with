00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,580
hi everybody and welcome to tents Flo

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,290
meets in this episode I'm chatting with

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,240
how hon Wong thank you for having me

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,219
here who's been doing some really really

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,320
cool work with neuroscience and

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,450
tensorflow and machine learning and all

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,890
kinds of cool stuff and even a new

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,020
course so you've been working on dyad ex

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,199
machina which is a beautiful name for

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,760
what looks like a beautiful site could

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,900
you tell us all about it

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,599
sure so I will start from the name diet

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,619
ex machina diet means to us one which is

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,040
me and my partner Christian family and

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,090
my Christian is going to be on a future

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,059
show which is great yes so machine

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,680
things we constantly work with machine

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,899
and we're at the intersection of deep

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,500
learning and affective computing so as

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,750
for why we started diet ex machina I

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,579
think the story really starts four to

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,789
five years ago when we first met so I

23
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,039
was a student in finance and he was

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,460
working in human behavior area and we

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,250
started to collaborate okay because we

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,530
both share the same strong interesting

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,659
machine learning right so one of the

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,520
first machine learning projects that we

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,520
work together is to create the trading

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,140
algorithms okay well so christian

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,310
challenges us to think outside the box

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,909
instead of using the traditional

33
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,159
technical or fundamental analysis into

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,290
your algorithm why can't we add some

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,080
human behavioral elements like emotions

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,020
into your algorithms well so we end up

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,750
including sentiment into our algorithm

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,420
and a surprisingly sentiment is a great

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,540
trading very indicated trading signals I

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
can see that because I'm sure when some

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,689
people are buying then everybody jumps

42
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,710
on board and when some people are

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,470
selling well so after that I think it

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,030
really brought emotion into our

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,460
attention and it was started to study um

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,180
a lot more into this fella affective

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,729
neuroscience especially and we're at

48
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,399
numerous spoke in the field and I think

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,829
we started notice a problem which is how

50
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,879
society at large tends to ignore how

51
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,430
important emotion is especially like in

52
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,710
our daily decision-making process

53
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,690
because people tend to overvalue

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,350
cognition and rationality okay over

55
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,860
emotion interesting yeah so I think well

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,020
that's really the starting point that we

57
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,180
think probably it's our job

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,030
this diet X marking us job to bring this

59
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,460
affective layer back into people's daily

60
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,650
life so it's II saw an opportunity to

61
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,240
bring emotion into what are

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,670
traditionally logical decisions yep okay

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,730
where it died X marking I started yeah

64
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,560
interesting and now a lot of the work

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
that you've been doing and a lot of the

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
learning that you've been doing you're

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,540
turning into a course now right yes so

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,910
yeah so start from there actually

69
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,610
well the here is where deep learning and

70
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,250
the tense of law came in okay so we were

71
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,880
studying machine learning and but then

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,760
we discovered deep learning okay so I

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,460
think so here is also the point that we

74
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,080
hit a point that we cannot make more

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,050
much anymore progress because we're both

76
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,270
working for time and it what data get

77
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,430
all our free time outraged a jobs just

78
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,310
the way don't they yep trying to

79
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,320
understand machine learning and

80
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,470
effective computing so I think we had a

81
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,200
discussion and made a hard decision I

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,380
what took one year off fully folks focus

83
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,780
fully on deep learning and effective

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,630
computing okay so here you can think of

85
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,280
this course and we end up making this

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
course because this course is really the

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,020
synthesis of our learning okay because

88
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,480
we really dedicate a lot of time and

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,820
effort on learning deep learning and we

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,640
think this course will be a great start

91
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
for people who are new to deep learning

92
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,390
to get started but more importantly I

93
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,880
think our main focus is to help people

94
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,940
who wants to use deep learning to the

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,670
film that they're passionate about to be

96
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,530
able to get started so your course is

97
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,120
about applied deep learning with

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,010
tensorflow and cloudy a I yes there's a

99
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,050
lot in there so what kind of content do

100
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,900
you have well so this is our very first

101
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,270
the course and we're a little bit

102
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,430
ambitious trying to put everything in

103
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,160
there but the course is really meant to

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,930
help to help people who are new to

105
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,120
machine learning to be able to build

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,580
their first deep learning model and take

107
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,430
it all the way to deploy their model as

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,940
production level

109
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,610
okay then we move on to talk about the

110
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,190
basics of deep learning okay and how to

111
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,639
design an experiment with some typical

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,539
neural networks using Charis Charis yeah

113
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,360
yep and then we move on with of deep

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,509
into tensor flow we start from low-level

115
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,150
tensor flow we introduce the concept

116
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,729
like data flow graph and the tensile

117
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,470
board then we move on to high-level

118
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,280
tensor flow then help people to build a

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
model in the cloud the trend amado

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
evaluate the model and eventually deploy

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,599
their model as a production level API so

122
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,370
the deployment part is really

123
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,659
fascinating to me because there's lots

124
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:08,680
of great material out there about

125
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,270
training models and maybe doing a little

126
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,400
bit of a test but making it real world

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,659
making it applied how intention help

128
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,659
people to apply it to the felt they're

129
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,949
interested in nice and we'll put a link

130
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,389
to the course in the comments below

131
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,449
so you've you've been starting you've

132
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,159
started with neuroscience and then

133
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,599
you've moved into taking a year off and

134
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,490
creating a course and you've obviously

135
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,169
gotten very deep into machine learning

136
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,729
and you've gotten very deep into

137
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,380
neuroscience and the intersection

138
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,180
between the two of them what advice

139
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,409
would you give to people who are just

140
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:42,880
starting out well yes so like to talk a

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
little bit about connected back to our

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,650
learning experience of journey of deep

143
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,560
learning and possible a little bit about

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,380
affective neuroscience okay so I think

145
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,509
we also summarize this four piece of

146
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,729
learning I'd like to share here the four

147
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,289
PS of learning well remember myself a

148
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,000
published article ow our website also

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,430
people can check check it out a link for

150
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,789
that so I don't need to remember it yeah

151
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,129
great so the first two P papers and

152
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,229
books okay well I think is really the

153
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,610
foundation because by we we make sure we

154
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,680
read papers and books every single day

155
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,279
and we got up 4:30 a.m. the first attack

156
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,340
is to repaper Wow deep learning papers

157
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,800
so the beginning we read some more like

158
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,139
basic deep learning paper to know what

159
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,940
is trendy in the fill to help people

160
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,159
solve problems with deep learning then

161
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,380
we move on to be more specific about our

162
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,750
domain how people use deep learning to

163
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,740
solve

164
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,470
like neuroscience problems affective

165
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,110
neuroscience problems so 4:30 a.m. for

166
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,330
the first P yeah you've lost me already

167
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,930
so papers and the books Pixar book

168
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,570
second P is practice practice okay yeah

169
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,640
so I think practice very important

170
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,100
especially like I think I'm very

171
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,020
passionate about like every day I will

172
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,060
use tensorflow to build some neural

173
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,950
networks start from the basic neural

174
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,500
networks and they understand like data

175
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
flow graph and to like I'm very

176
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,570
interested interested in using tensor

177
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,770
forward to visualize my training and

178
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,720
evaluating results and how to tune my

179
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,660
models like hyper parameters so I think

180
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,660
then practice and you can find those

181
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,290
problems very easily on cargo and a

182
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,580
proud day I yeah

183
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,100
so the third P which with I think

184
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,080
personally is very helpful for my

185
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,840
learning which is preach preach yeah you

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,870
can think of lecturing or teaching okay

187
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,410
so every day I will give a Christian as

188
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,450
meaning lecture about what I learned

189
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,730
during the day about deep learning and

190
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,860
some theories or even your network I

191
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,650
built that day so I think it's mutually

192
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,960
beneficial helped me to consolidate my

193
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
knowledge and help him to have overview

194
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,060
about what I learned and also making

195
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,419
some progress yeah yeah from his side oh

196
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,530
well last Appy I think we think is

197
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,810
really helping us to get where we are

198
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,330
right now is passion yeah they're

199
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,030
definitely new passions yeah so well

200
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,030
first was like I mentioned we saw this

201
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,680
great potential of deep learning and a

202
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,630
tensor flow that you can leverage to

203
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,060
really bring the transformative change

204
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,360
into you into the domain because because

205
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,729
it's new technology and regularly in the

206
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,400
past at least based on our study about

207
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,099
the affective neuroscience no one has

208
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,469
ever leverage this technology to build

209
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,350
any algorithm yet so where you set out

210
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,660
to make that happen so bringing emotion

211
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,310
into algorithms yes that sounds

212
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,250
fascinating so so you started this

213
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,230
journey you know as you were doing

214
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,180
financial trading stuff and did

215
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,550
took a look at emotions and that you

216
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,440
know from out of that has grown Diet ex

217
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,070
machina and now your course if your

218
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,529
daily four PS that you're doing there's

219
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,240
a lot of amazing stuff there so so

220
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,020
what's next for how hard yes so next for

221
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,339
me and guides machina is where right now

222
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,140
still working on doing running

223
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,600
experiments every day and doing research

224
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
in affective computing area we're trying

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,040
to put things together to be able to

226
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,260
eventually present to the share with the

227
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,020
community so we're we will be working on

228
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,540
this part of part of the study what's

229
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,790
more it's another thing about the course

230
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,209
okay we are planning to make a new

231
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,510
course and we plan to deliver the course

232
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,950
by the end of this year or the beginning

233
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,779
of next year the course will be called

234
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,200
effective computing okay and deep

235
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,959
learning using tensor flow affective

236
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,730
computing and deep learning using tensor

237
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,790
flow yes I look forward to it yeah so in

238
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,290
this course we will be teaching people

239
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,650
how to use tensor flow and a Google

240
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,810
cloud machine learning engine to

241
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,730
streaming your psychophysiological

242
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,970
signals over time and to process your

243
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,430
signals and eventually the algorithm

244
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,890
should be able to make a real-time

245
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,720
prediction about your affective state

246
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,209
okay yeah excellent so your course on

247
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,529
effective computing it's going to be

248
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,940
coming out pretty soon maybe the end of

249
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,500
this year or sometime early next year

250
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,029
and maybe after the course comes down

251
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,529
we'll have you on again to talk about it

252
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:26,290
yes I would love to so we look forward

253
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,390
to it so thanks so much how Hanh and
