00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,520
welcome everybody to tensorflow meets

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,080
and this is our very first episode of

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,880
this show tensorflow meets is a show

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,230
where we meet with people in the

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,400
community who are working with

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,940
tensorflow

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,099
today it's my honor to meet finally with

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,929
chip she's teaching the famous cs20

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,699
course at Stanford I have to tell a

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,500
story before we begin about how I met

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,529
chip so I was studying and studying some

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,269
AI in Stanford and there was a robotics

13
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,420
course what was the instructor great

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,429
instruction he's amazing super cool guy

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,260
and the first homework assignment came

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,070
in and I did not have a clue years ago

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,680
was it that long okay and I just

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,390
remember and it was like you had offered

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,610
fit to help and like I was totally stuck

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,600
with this thing I chipped kind of

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,219
scribbled this thing on a napkin and

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,899
scanned it and emailed it to me and I

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,210
was like then suddenly I knew what was

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,680
going on and a second I knew this girl

25
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,180
was going to go places after that and

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,670
now look at you you're teaching you just

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,989
say that so as a tower

28
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,550
actually still considering doing an

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,920
English major because I came to Stanford

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,559
as a as a writer before Stanford I was

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,330
like trembling a little bit and then

32
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,220
wrote a couple of books and I really

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,140
liked writing but then I took this one

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,540
CS course I see us on 6 a.m. I everyone

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,729
s neighbor takes this 106a everybody yes

36
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,750
right yes and he said like okay like you

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,549
work here then you sort of like had to

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,930
take this course and take you to the

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,670
stand robotics right of the course

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,590
doctors I did like see us more and more

41
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,040
and yeah ya know you had written like

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,810
travel books in Vietnam right I'd like

43
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,290
to call them stories it was traveling

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,930
for almost three years like in Asia

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,340
Africa and South America

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,829
and it'll books about people I met and

47
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,110
what I saw and what I thought of their

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,869
life it was a whole new world to me like

49
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,520
that in so it's a journey from like

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,530
travel and meeting people about life and

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,210
then coming to study like an English

52
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,939
major and then in CS and now teaching AI

53
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,219
so tell us about the course I has an

54
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,990
idea when I was a sophomore and it was

55
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,479
doing one class natural language

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,759
processing and the course used

57
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,490
tensorflow I started digging into the

58
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,770
library and they did it all during the

59
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,220
summer I use it for my job at a startup

60
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,260
it was pretty early

61
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,290
of the tensile flow progress so there

62
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,420
was not a lot of documentation okay I

63
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,430
had a lot of trouble trying to figure

64
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,980
out what you do and and then I look into

65
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,200
the source code and get up and I said

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,970
wow this is like such a huge library

67
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,760
with so many amazing talks and why does

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,349
like what did they know by it before

69
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,330
maybe there should be a group we were

70
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,860
can just meet and learn from each other

71
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,290
and so I told you some of my professors

72
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,209
Stanford and we have a course on this of

73
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,799
flow and they were like we are too busy

74
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,060
to teach it so you know this is your

75
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,470
secondary of teaching it right now yeah

76
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,569
how's it been like picked up by students

77
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,480
do they like it um for me as a student

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,730
I'm not I for me two pictures of course

79
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,400
I need a faculty sponsorship and Chris

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
Manning was a person who did it and he

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,629
advertised a course on a very popular

82
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,579
course that he was teaching so the first

83
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,410
year was pretty overwhelming we got like

84
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,299
350 applications Wow I was only allowed

85
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,459
to take 20 because I'm not allowed to

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,709
like take more students than that nicely

87
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,989
yeah things the feedback was a pretty

88
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,209
positive and then Stanford

89
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,669
let me do it again look at more students

90
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,680
but I because I'm still carrying of food

91
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,389
work roles as a student stand for so I

92
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,280
don't think I'm I'm ready for like a lot

93
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,930
of students so this year we have about a

94
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,959
40 okay yeah it takes me on average 20

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,660
hours a week one lecture there to

96
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,430
lecture so doesn't mean 40 hours it's a

97
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,230
full-time job that's just a lot of time

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,639
a lot of the information that you've put

99
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,959
together for the course is available to

100
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,250
the public right your code is on github

101
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,540
and stuff like that

102
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,919
have you seen like any uptake from

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,079
students or from people outside using

104
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,910
your code or learning from your code I

105
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,239
think it was surprised at how many uses

106
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,340
so I guess use a github repo just shake

107
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,569
it on and I was like wow do you know

108
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,790
that's like they're like an average like

109
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,849
2,000 visitors I've only recently joined

110
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,980
the tensorflow team and just in the last

111
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,510
couple of months so I've been scouring

112
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,040
the web for things to learn how am I

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,090
gonna learn this how am I gonna learn

114
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,099
that and almost every like site that I

115
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,629
fall on well people always end up

116
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,790
pointing back to your github repo so

117
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,260
it's okay if you want to learn how to do

118
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,819
like a linear regression look at chips

119
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,410
codon if you want to learn how to do

120
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,299
this look at chips code so it's just

121
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,130
saying some of it is a bit embarrassing

122
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,130
because now because this year when I'm

123
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,460
preparing

124
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,919
again I redirect them notes from last

125
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,350
night oh my god is this you know like

126
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,300
when it when you try to make a joke but

127
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,039
it wasn't funny it just showed on the

128
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,780
paper it was like oh my God why did I

129
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,759
even do that

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,259
it's it's a constant process of

131
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,430
improving it's the same when you're

132
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,229
doing developer advocacy work it's like

133
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,910
sometimes like I look back on talks that

134
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,889
I've done it like no those jokes didn't

135
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,530
work I'm glad I get a chance to do it

136
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,720
again so I can have a slightly more

137
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,500
polished so say I'm a developer and like

138
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm a typical software developer right

139
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,900
now and I really want to get into the AI

140
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,370
machine learning and there's a there's a

141
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,900
whole universe of technologies out there

142
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,509
AI nml what advice would you give me I

143
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,009
think it's a bit hard way to get advice

144
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,570
okay I think of myself as somebody who's

145
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,460
a starting I have been doing it for like

146
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,000
a little bit two years now it's because

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,590
it's such a nascent technology two years

148
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,720
is a long time so your experience is

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,849
very valuable so I think is it really

150
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,550
depends on on what exactly you want to

151
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,009
get into because yeah like MLA is very

152
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,360
broad so you can either become a

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,919
software developer so you can develop

154
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,259
tools like as a flow or pie chart you

155
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,150
can also be like apply research finishes

156
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,979
when you apply this a new research into

157
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,050
into production or I can just become a

158
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,419
very pure researcher so I come up with

159
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,340
new algorithms you know your new

160
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,250
architectures so for me um are they make

161
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,320
as for me I have always wanted to become

162
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,289
a researcher so in fact that for that

163
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,870
massive math is very important to me and

164
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,909
Jay brow need to know a matrix-matrix

165
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,009
multiplication yeah yeah so I think it

166
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,169
would recommend that you nature gets up

167
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,479
leadership brought back growl like shut

168
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,210
up and dinner so me some probability

169
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,340
okay background because everything is

170
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,669
indeed you Bhushan in this and anything

171
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,800
read a lot of papers so some advice that

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,020
have got from people who are in the fail

173
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,340
for a long time this is tell me to read

174
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,099
a lot of papers like this tell me like

175
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,229
in every morning check okay like

176
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,000
whatever photo like most popular papers

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,759
oh wow and yes dedication yeah just like

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
review them I like scheme does the

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
abstract she doesn't so know that they

180
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,909
what I go up to in the field right and

181
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,349
then take a lot of online courses

182
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,060
there's so many online courses available

183
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,120
for free and I yeah and after needs a

184
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,880
paper you can add implement it yourself

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,580
like yes you try because you cannot

186
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,020
render standard paper until you actually

187
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,620
like a man was a paper something about

188
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,060
and also can look at how other people

189
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,850
implement that um online just to compare

190
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,350
like the way you approach a problem

191
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,080
that's the magic of open source yeah and

192
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,430
like as we're talking about early run

193
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,750
like the open source that you've written

194
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,130
