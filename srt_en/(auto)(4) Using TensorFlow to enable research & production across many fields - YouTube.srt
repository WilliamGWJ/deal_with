00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,250
hi everybody and welcome to the 10th

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,720
afloat developer summit I'm Laurence

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,279
Moroney reporting from the tensorflow

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,560
cafe and it's my pleasure to have Megan

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,240
catch olya with me in this episode now

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,880
Meghan great keynote you gave there was

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,530
lots of great information on there and

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,420
we had Jeff on the show a few minutes

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,220
ago and he was talking about like some

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,359
of the great stuff that's been done with

11
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,949
tensorflow and we shared some great

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,630
examples could you tell us about them

13
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,609
yeah well actually there was one example

14
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,250
I really liked in Anita's section as

15
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,140
well also kind of right at the beginning

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,289
there was the example about the planet

17
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,780
discovery and the reason I really like

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,010
this one is because it was someone in my

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,960
team and it really was one of these

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,460
things where someone came and it was

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,530
there like I have this idea this data is

22
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,110
publicly available can we try this I'm

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,789
not sure if it's gonna work but I'm

24
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,329
excited about it okay sure 20% project

25
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,300
why not they're like oh how is it what's

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
it like being in brain and on tend to

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,480
flow I'm like oh one of my Swedes

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,350
discovered planets it's it's pretty cool

29
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,420
so what did you do so I think that's

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,640
really amazing just because when you

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,619
take a step back and think about it this

32
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,270
is a person who has very strong software

33
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,860
engineering skills he's good at machine

34
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,900
learning he knows it but he's not an

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,060
astrophysicist yep he's never discovered

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,650
like doesn't stop with NASA or anything

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,290
before it was just the data was there he

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,360
was excited about trying it and we found

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,509
a way to make a work I thought that was

40
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,040
really to me that just a really cool

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,320
example of like oh wow like there are

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,549
these problems that before we're like

43
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,079
well we can have a human sift through

44
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,189
all this and maybe figure some things

45
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,259
out right we can actually find things

46
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,110
out better by using machine learning and

47
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,310
then everyone's really excited about

48
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,770
what we've found so I really like that

49
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,950
one that one's one of my favorites it's

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,780
not just discovering the planet but it's

51
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,189
also a solar system that has multiple

52
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,200
planets yes so being able to get to the

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,759
resolution of saying hey it's not just

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,810
we know there's a planet around this

55
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,310
star many light-years away there are

56
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,950
eight of them you know I think it's 30

57
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,990
light years anyway but I think that just

58
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,850
blows my mind because it's not that long

59
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,380
ago like he said it was only the top

60
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,750
astrophysicists and astronomers we might

61
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,369
be able to measure wobble in a star and

62
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,200
say I think there's a planet there now

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,489
what machine learned data we can have

64
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,599
somebody go nope there's eight of them

65
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,850
exactly

66
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,350
you shared some examples in your keynote

67
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,820
that I really like like protecting the

68
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,220
rainforests and air traffic control

69
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,440
right so what have you been involved in

70
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,960
any of them or is your team not directly

71
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
in any of those examples I don't think I

72
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,580
do have a few folks who have worked on

73
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,980
some of the medical examples that I need

74
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,150
to talked about and then Jeff kind of

75
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,640
talked more about as well I think those

76
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,070
are really exciting and just because

77
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,020
it's a way of augmenting doctors and

78
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,220
helping them right you can give them

79
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,420
more tools you can give them more

80
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,890
information you can give them more data

81
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,960
it's not that you can replace doctors

82
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,230
but you can give them more help so that

83
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,250
they can do their job better and

84
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,950
actually help more people especially in

85
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,540
places where they're just part enough

86
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,070
doctors or aren't enough folks who have

87
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,050
the right kind of training the right I

88
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,480
think that's really exciting just to see

89
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,800
the certain things like the the retina

90
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,070
scans right the different all the other

91
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,840
stuff they're doing in ophthalmology

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,830
I've had a couple of folks who've worked

93
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,200
on some of those projects as well but I

94
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,790
always find those really exciting

95
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,650
because it's applying machine learning

96
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,540
to a problem we already know about but

97
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,660
the results are so amazing just they you

98
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,710
can make things better for people

99
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,480
Jeff and I were joking it said but it's

100
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,710
true it's like it's computer vision

101
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,580
helping real vision yes I really like

102
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,500
the air traffic control example because

103
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,150
you know I used to live really right

104
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,920
beside the main air traffic control

105
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,900
center for New York and it was like the

106
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,830
one thing that I learned is how

107
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,450
stressful the job it is to and to think

108
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,130
how quickly people burn out doing that

109
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,750
job but then having something to at

110
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,010
least the system obviously it can't

111
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,420
replace them but to at least the system

112
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,040
in that job because prediction and

113
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,960
projection I mean it's that's what they

114
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,610
have to do in split second that's

115
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:51,910
correct

116
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,950
the more data or the more information

117
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,390
they can have at their hands or the

118
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,860
faster they can get it at their

119
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,660
fingertips the better off we'll be in

120
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,130
making the right choices and helping

121
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,870
direct everything correctly it takes a

122
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,730
special gift to do that job so anything

123
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,320
we can do to help them and keep us safer

124
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,500
while we're in the air just just just

125
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,510
really blew my mind so now of course all

126
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,010
of this is made possible by tensorflow

127
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,959
and you're part of the engineering team

128
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,540
for tensorflow how does it feel to to be

129
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,859
building all this or to be helping to

130
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,470
build all this it's really exciting I

131
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,200
mean

132
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,610
think sometimes with it's like with any

133
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,740
job you might get lost in the day-to-day

134
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,480
of it right we have teams to run we have

135
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,010
to make sure we're building the right

136
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,040
things but I think the most exciting

137
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,540
thing is when we get to take a step back

138
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,800
and be like what's the community trying

139
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,630
to do right what types of things are

140
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,520
they trying to vote how do we help go in

141
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,630
some of those different directions

142
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,370
whether it's just make it easier for

143
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,080
more people to use things because now

144
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
the API is are simpler or those

145
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,470
higher-level API is like Kerris or

146
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,390
whether it's like okay we know there's

147
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,130
really some experts out there who wants

148
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,110
to just fine-tune and hand tune

149
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,240
everything give them the capability to

150
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,950
do that and tell them how to do it for a

151
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,590
really powerful hardware so I think it's

152
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,650
it's one of those groups especially at

153
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,030
Google you don't see as many where they

154
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,320
get to have this external community

155
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,390
interaction I find that to be the most

156
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,410
interesting thing because people

157
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,770
externally are watching what we're doing

158
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,180
we're held accountable to you know to

159
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,680
the team or to the group

160
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,210
we're held accountable to all the folks

161
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,920
who are using tensorflow as well and who

162
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,790
want to use it for different

163
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,460
applications so I find that actually one

164
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,470
of the most exciting things about

165
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,340
tensorflow as a project is that it's not

166
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,960
just about like oh we're doing something

167
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,910
inside for Google no no we're really

168
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,590
looking at like what does it mean for

169
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,330
the community how are we helping all the

170
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,830
different groups how are we enabling

171
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,500
research how are we naming production so

172
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,630
I find that the most the most part the

173
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,490
people are awesome as well and I mean

174
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,540
there are people out there with

175
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,850
world-beating ideas and no way to

176
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,680
implement them right and it's a part of

177
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,820
what we're trying to do is to

178
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,010
democratize AI so that they can go out

179
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,970
there and they can implement them

180
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,760
because we can't think of everything

181
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,070
we're enabling and helping it's actually

182
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,660
really cold as a board just outside the

183
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,800
cafe where people have been writing
