2
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,189
earlier this year we hit the milestone

3
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,439
of 11 million downloads you're really

4
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,450
excited to see how much users are using

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,430
this in how much impact it's having in

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,940
the world I'm very excited to say that

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,650
we have been working with other teams in

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,989
Google to bring tensorflow Lite to

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,020
Google Apps

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,760
so if retentive flow is also an early

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,100
stage project and so we'd really love

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,600
for you to get interested and help us to

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,210
build this future told you at the

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,890
beginning that our mission for Kiev data

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,510
was to make a library for him food

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,850
processing that is fast flexible and

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,160
easy to use we're very excited today to

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,880
announce that the plan Jas is joining

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,010
the Tanza flow family in general but the

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,510
Google brain teams mission is to make

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,580
machines intelligent and then use that

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,170
ability to improve people's lives I

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,030
think these are good examples of where

24
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,770
there's real opportunity for this
