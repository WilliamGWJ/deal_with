1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,370
everybody and welcome to the tensorflow

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,899
developer summit and welcome to the

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,609
tents of hope cafe at this summit I'm

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,319
Laurence Moroney and it's my honor to

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,510
chat with Jeff Dean and the keynote has

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,790
just finished Jeff Gray keynote thank

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,290
you thank you I really love the part

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,340
where you were talking about like you

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,780
know looking at changing the future

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,220
using tensorflow and some of the great

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,080
stuff that we're doing so could you tell

12
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,609
me a little bit more about it sure I

13
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,279
mean I think over the last four or five

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,320
years we've really seen tremendous

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,300
developments in a lot of sort of core

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,980
areas of machine learning research being

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,219
turned from sort of research ideas into

18
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,780
things that are actually practical

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,250
things that you can use to solve

20
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,530
problems across a really wide set of

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,020
domains right and I think that's part of

22
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,059
the excitement is we know that things

23
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,219
like computer vision that works well

24
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,559
speech recognition you know

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,379
understanding language and sequences all

26
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,030
these things can be applied in so many

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,440
different areas of the world it's just

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,600
amazing and you know in the keynote I

29
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,210
sort of highlighted things through the

30
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,890
lens of the National Academy of

31
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,809
Engineering in the United States they

32
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,329
put out a list of these 14 grand

33
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,950
engineering challenges I talked about 14

34
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,220
of yeah so you highlighted two of them

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,170
right yeah yeah

36
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,350
one was engineering the tools of

37
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,520
scientific discovery and I think

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,770
actually tensorflow itself is a kind of

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,840
a key part of that because machine

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,420
learning is very clearly impacting many

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,710
different scientific domains and

42
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,130
engineering domains today and so for

43
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,720
example our group has done some research

44
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,140
on how to use machine learning to tackle

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,880
quantum chemistry problems right and

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,530
like that's not immediately an obvious

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,600
fit in most people's minds but you can

48
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,030
actually train a machine learning model

49
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,759
that emulates the behavior of a very

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,329
expensive more traditional HPC style

51
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,189
quantum chemistry simulator and you get

52
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,740
essentially the same accuracy but it's

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,329
three hundred thousand times faster and

54
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,490
so that just wood is a fundamentally

55
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,049
different kind of tool for chemists

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,070
right if you have something that's three

57
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,659
hundred thousand done faster you know

58
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,250
you can imagine screening a hundred

59
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,960
million candidate molecule

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,090
configurations and finding the ten

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,229
thousand that are most interesting

62
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,360
whereas you couldn't do that before and

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
it also means that more

64
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,330
research opportunities can open up right

65
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,790
because your 300 times 300 thousand

66
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,319
times faster means that there's more

67
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,549
bandwidth to try different things

68
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,019
different experiments that's right and

69
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,450
like all of the 14 challenges sort of

70
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,640
four of them were related to things that

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,890
I think better understanding of chemical

72
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,500
properties of and materials were going

73
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,819
to be pretty important in things like

74
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,560
you know making solar energy more

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,980
affordable or things like that and so

76
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,810
machine learning clearly can tackle

77
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,510
those things but engineering the tools

78
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,190
of scientists scientific discovery is a

79
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,980
pretty broad area and one of the things

80
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,299
I talked about was being able to

81
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,629
automate solving of new problems with

82
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,190
machine learning I think one of the

83
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,930
problems in the world is there so much

84
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,180
potential for applying machine learning

85
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,890
to different problems but there's a

86
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,560
fairly limited set of people that have

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,109
the skills and expertise to really do

88
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,090
that effectively I'm by democratizing

89
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,079
that you're broadening that base of

90
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,720
people that's right you can happen in

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,769
one of the other things he spoke about

92
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,599
which was close to my heart was really

93
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,549
health care and you spoke about like the

94
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:17,040
diabetic retinopathy retinopathy yes I

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,709
could never say the word like it's just

96
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,349
amazing like how they did scale of a

97
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,630
machine learn system can approach that

98
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,579
and even surpass that of many humans now

99
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,060
right I mean I think the realization and

100
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,519
an advances in computer vision you know

101
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,400
mean that the same pretty much the same

102
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,889
technology that is powering labeling

103
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,660
your google photos with like is that a

104
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,819
picture of a mountain or a Labrador it

105
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,980
can be applied to medical imaging

106
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,139
problems and our group has been doing a

107
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,359
lot of work in many different sort of

108
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,540
domains and medical imaging

109
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,540
ophthalmology pathology radiology

110
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,709
dermatology kinds of problems we're sort

111
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,900
of farthest along and started the

112
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,579
earliest on ophthalmology problems

113
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,379
because it's a very unmet need around

114
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,359
the world they're just in many parts of

115
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,290
the world they just aren't enough

116
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,930
opthamologist to screen people for this

117
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,720
disease diabetic retinopathy and it's a

118
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,340
very serious and degenerative eye

119
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,299
disease so you can actually lose your

120
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,819
vision if it's not diagnosed in time but

121
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,650
if you catch it in time then it's very

122
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,010
treatable

123
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,599
yeah and it's a beautiful symmetry that

124
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,039
computer vision is helping real vision

125
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,280
that's right

126
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,690
I only thought of it when you said

127
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,770
computer visionary and then I mean the

128
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,389
one thing that we showed in the keynote

129
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:31,710
that was really inspiring was their

130
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,020
cassava and the example of cassava and

131
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,730
using like mobile phones that diagnosed

132
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,190
and leave right the if it and I know you

133
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,630
grew up we spent some of your childhood

134
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,370
in Africa yeah I actually moved around

135
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,770
quite a bit as a kid and one of the

136
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,290
places that I lived was in East Africa

137
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,330
in northwestern Uganda for a year when I

138
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,400
was five I also spent six months in

139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,389
Somalia when I was 13 but in Uganda in

140
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,700
that particular area cassava is sort of

141
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,560
one of the fundamental crops that's

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,540
grown to sort of provide most of the

143
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,050
basic nutrition for for meals and you

144
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,790
know when I was five we were living in

145
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,790
this very rural small village of like

146
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,700
thousand people so it's a very agrarian

147
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,860
kind of kind of area I used to love to

148
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,240
go out in the fields and kind of help

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,870
pull up cassava and things and so

150
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,600
actually when I saw this this video of a

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,229
group at Penn State and at the ìiî TA

152
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,880
Institute in Tanzania that it done some

153
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,570
work on diagnosis of disease versus not

154
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,419
disease cassava leaves essentially do

155
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,220
you take pictures of leaves and then you

156
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,200
can tell you know is this a healthy

157
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,970
plant or is a disease and if it's

158
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,940
diseased you know what you should do to

159
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,640
treat it and and that's like a very

160
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,350
useful and and fundamental thing that

161
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,780
you can do and it relies on machine

162
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,970
learning and computer vision and sort of

163
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,280
an app crafted so that farmers can do

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,900
this but it's almost the stuff of sci-fi

165
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,120
right that you if you told me five years

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
ago that you could go out with a mobile

167
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,669
phone and start looking at leaves and

168
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,110
then diagnose if their disease they're

169
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,820
not it would be it'd be hard to believe

170
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,169
but now it's possible and now it's

171
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,030
happening there's so many potential

172
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,229
applications of this and you know

173
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,669
another one of my favorites is the

174
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,039
Google Translate app which has the

175
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,110
ability to like you turn on the camera

176
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,330
on your phone and you hover over text in

177
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,060
another language and it superimposes

178
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,680
translated text oh yes and so that

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
relies on many different kinds of

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,620
machine learning in there there's like

181
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,450
the computer vision to do the OCR to

182
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,430
recognize the text and then there's

183
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,440
another machine learning model to

184
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,030
actually do the translation from one

185
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,740
language to another and then another

186
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,960
model to figure out how to superimpose

187
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,810

188
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,419
back in the font that you were actually

189
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,639
seeing it in in the original vertical

190
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,160
and hovered over and it's just like very

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,610
cool how you know these magical

192
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,310
experiences can be crafted from you know

193
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,050
a few core machine learning models

194
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,490
stitched together in the right way and

195
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,930
it also makes the world a smaller place

196
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,150
right so I mean I spend a lot of time

197
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,560
traveling and like exactly that

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,510
translation thing that it saved me from

199
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,889
embarrassing myself by ordering

200
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,260
something I don't like

201
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,430
especially in languages where the script

202
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,139
is even very different than the script

203
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,000
her familiar with I think that's you

204
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,860
know you just feel very lost and this

205
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,450
can make you feel lots long yeah it's
