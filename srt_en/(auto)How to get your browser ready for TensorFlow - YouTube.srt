00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:08,370
did you know that tensorflow j/s isn't

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,170
just for JavaScript on the backend with

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,860
node but can also be used in the browser

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,870
yes you can train models in the browser

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,510
with JavaScript and not only that you

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,300
can run inference too and if that wasn't

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,949
enough you can have models that you've

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,260
trained elsewhere and run inference on

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,800
those in the browser using javascript so

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,380
today's tip is how do I get my browser

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,110
ready for tensorflow and this one's

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,180
almost cheating it's a little too easy

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,579
so let's start with the simplest web

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,559
page imaginable we'll save and run it

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,570
and we'll see that we just get an empty

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,899
page so let's add a script tag to the

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,969
head and we'll add the tensorflow dot

19
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,050
j/s script to that we can save and run

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,910
it again and now look at the page

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,219
there's not allowed to see right now so

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,899
let's add a div to the page and we'll

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,070
output to that later

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,260
so now let's add a simple script for

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,239
training a model to infer a linear

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,150
relationship we'll create a model and

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,430
just add a single layer to it and we'll

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,170
specify the loss function and the

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,450
optimizer after that we'll specify a

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,610
couple of tensors for the values one

31
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,229
tensor has the X values and the other

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,240
has the Y there's a relationship between

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,509
them which is y equals 2x minus 1 but

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,360
the models going to infer that we train

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,540
the model with model dot fit and then

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,700
we'll output the prediction for y where

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,950
x equals 10 now of course it should be

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,049
about 19 so let's take a look and see

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,530
and we actually get pretty close so

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,210
there's your start in using tensorflow

41
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,100
with javascript I do hope this was a

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,049
useful primer for you for more great
