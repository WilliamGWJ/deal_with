00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,060
hi and welcome to ask tensorflow the

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,350
show where you get to ask questions

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,719
about tensorflow and we will try to

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,849
answer them my name is Magnus it's 10

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,530
I work as a developer advocate on the

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,910
tensorflow team and I'm Laurence Moroney

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,130
also a developer advocate on the team so

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,750
let's get started the first question is

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,310
from Bern burst on Twitter and the

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,619
question is how about advice on the

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,180
suitable data set for a learning

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,529
experience on tensorflow

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,380
that's a great question yes it is

15
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,179
there's a few that are great for

16
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,850
starting there's always kaggle who has

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,340
lots of open data sets that you can use

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,170
so if you don't have a user account on

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,730
Carole you should definitely check it

20
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,210
out

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,640
also models that are bundled will

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,239
tensorflow

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,980
you can find these in the tensorflow

24
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,520
slash models github directory and many

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,430
of them are from well-known AI /ml

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,199
problems including things like the

27
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,480
m-miss data set which is really the

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,840
hello world or machine learning to that

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,969
allows you to help classify handwritten

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,620
digits they can even detect my

31
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,019
handwriting it's doing something there's

32
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,850
also a tutorial called wide and deep

33
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,490
that uses census data from the UC irvine

34
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,680
machine learning repository indeed you

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,450
can find lots of data sets in that

36
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,430
repository to play with I actually found

37
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,680
one for a tutorial that I was writing

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,790
and it was from the West

39
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,650
Wisconsin breast cancer research data

40
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,479
and that was in the UC Irvine machine

41
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,220
learning repository so I wrote a

42
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,720
tutorial around that and you can see it

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,939
in the links underneath so the next

44
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,070
question comes from NAT Carly on Twitter

45
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,310
and not asks can I retrain a model to

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,930
recognize an object is something else

47
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,630
for example if it sees a sunflower and I

48
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,270
want to classify that as a weed instead

49
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,189
so this all falls into something that we

50
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,380
call retraining and the concept of

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,869
retraining removes the last layer which

52
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,329
contains the class labels and allows you

53
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,729
to relearn it with your own labels now

54
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,740
it's too long for me to explain it here

55
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,570
but fortunately we have something called

56
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,850
a tensor flow for poets code lab I've

57
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,070
put a link in the description below in

58
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,140
that code lab you'll take a look at the

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,689
standard mobile net code lab and retrain

60
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,850
it specifically for flowers I'd strongly

61
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,439
recommend looking into that and having a

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,840
play with it yeah it's a very common

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,110
technique in fact you can train a model

64
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,770
quite easy

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,050
silly with not so many example using

66
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,790
this kind of methodology which speeds

67
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,100
things up to right now yeah and the next

68
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,690
question is from Karim on Twitter and

69
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,280
the question is what's your best advice

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,590
for a computer science student to begin

71
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,770
in AI /ml the top three things to do top

72
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,300
three it's hard to think of just three

73
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,720
right yeah well I think a clear number

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,900
one is to learn Python not just for ml

75
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,820
but also because it's a staggeringly

76
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,670
cool and useful language I can't believe

77
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,890
the things I've been able to achieve as

78
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,780
since I learned and it's used everywhere

79
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,720
in machine learning and data science so

80
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,480
my number two after I've learned Python

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
would be to study some of the math

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,590
that's used in ml and it might be the

83
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,910
girl who don't want to learn math but

84
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,680
it's really not that bad and the two

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,240
parts of math that I really look into

86
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,340
number one would be regression so

87
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,140
regression is all around fitting align

88
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,000
two points in two dimension or a plane

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,950
two points in three dimensions as well

90
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,660
as getting into higher-order dimensions

91
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,760
and then the other one is matrices and

92
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,950
understanding how matrices fit the

93
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,360
picture for handling this higher-order

94
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,910
dimensional math so how to multiply and

95
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,830
transpose matrices and all that kind of

96
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,640
thing mm-hmm

97
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,290
how about number three number three my

98
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,910
number three would then be to practice

99
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,650
on simple examples then there are do

100
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,840
some great data sets out there as we

101
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,820
mentioned at the top of the show you

102
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,709
should download them play with them in a

103
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,510
spreadsheet and do correlations and

104
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,130
stuff and then you should load them into

105
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,990
a machine learning model to see if you

106
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,180
can do some classification and above all

107
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,740
have fun with it

108
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,250
yeah and there's so many amazing things

109
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,160
you can do with even quite simple models

110
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,170
so you should really go out there and

111
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,510
just try things out and if you love what

112
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,070
you do you'll do what you love yeah

113
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,040
right so next question this one comes

114
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,310
from Mitsuki in Tokyo and MIT's kiosks

115
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,040
at i/o last year we heard about TP use

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,580
when and how will they be available well

117
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,350
arigato meet Sachi that's a fabulous

118
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,060
question and fortunately it's really

119
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,530
easy to answer because they're now

120
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,090
available for you to play with in beta

121
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,310
there are details of the URL at the blog

122
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,380
post that I've linked underneath now

123
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,520
with some of the things we've have

124
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,900
there's some really really impressive

125
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,630
power available so the TP user that are

126
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,070
available on the cloud platform

127
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,360
pack up to a hundred and eighty

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,490
teraflops of floating-point performance

129
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,670
and about 64 gigabytes of high bandwidth

130
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,630
memory on a single board 180 teraflops

131
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,970
tariff teraflops that's a that's a Giga

132
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,040
gigaflop arraign that's a lot of flops

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,260
so we actually did a test on one of

134
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,810
these and a trained resonate 50 in less

135
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,000
than a day and when we actually posted

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,740
the first blog post about this we said

137
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,450
it cost less than two hundred dollars in

138
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,800
total we've actually been doing

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,270
retraining since then and it's come

140
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,060
closer to 100 dollars in total to train

141
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,490
a complete resonate 50 so how does this

142
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,440
work well TPU usage is paid for by the

143
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,600
second so the faster you go effectively

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,370
the cheaper it is and we have a tutorial

145
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,160
about using TP use to Train ResNet let's

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,050
add a little underneath I'd love to hear

147
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,400
what you're planning to do and the type

148
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
of machine learning you're going to be

149
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,060
doing so thanks everybody

150
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,400
again a lot of really really fun

151
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,530
questions some great stuff that we've

152
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,970
been able to look into we hope we've

153
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,920
been able to help you with answers to

154
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,730
these questions

155
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,650
I'm Lawrence and this is Magnus and

156
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,210
remember if you've got any more

157
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,010
questions for us please leave them in

158
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,200
the comments below or better still post

159
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,700
them on social media with the hashtag

160
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,280
ask tensorflow and we'll be here to

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,060
answer them for you

162
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,640
thank you so much

163
