00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,830
this week's question is one that I get

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,800
asked a lot how do I use tensorflow in

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,889
an IDE like pycharm and even if I have

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,780
it already installed it just doesn't

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,699
seem to get recognized and that's a

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,760
great question so let's take a look

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
here's the IDE PyCharm and it's a

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,630
personal favorite of mine if you've used

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,050
Android studio it'll look very familiar

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,910
here you can see I have a very simple

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,399
script written in Python but it's saying

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,870
that I don't have a module named

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,620
tensorflow

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,440
or even a module named numpy but if I go

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,230
to a terminal and I type Python and then

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,899
import tensorflow as TF and I'll print

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,940
the version of tensorflow you'll see

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,399
that I have tensorflow 1.6 installed so

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,250
what gives pycharm uses a virtual

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,920
environment to run tensorflow in and in

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,079
this case tensorflow and numpy haven't

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,449
been installed to this specific virtual

23
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,340
environment so let's take a look at

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,620
installing them now what's nice about

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,300
this is that I can try different

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,850
versions of the library on different

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,890
virtual machines so in this virtual

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,260
environment I'll install a later version

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,360
of tensorflow

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,460
so in my project settings if I go to the

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,619
project interpreter take a look at a

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,720
list of packages and then click the plus

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll get a list of packages that I can

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,210
install and tensorflow is one of these

35
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,070
what's really neat about this is that I

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,229
can then specify the version I want to

37
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,049
install so I can pick for example 1.8

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,270
which was the most up-to-date version at

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,970
the time of recording this you can see

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,509
now that it's installing version 1.8 now

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,950
you can see it has successfully

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,280
installed and I have 1.8 so I can escape

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,549
out of there and go back to the editor

44
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,750
sometimes it takes the editor a few

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,490
moments to catch up so the red

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,030
underlines are still there but now I can

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,369
run my app without an error and in my

48
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,200
console you can see that it's training

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,590
and the values are coming out so that's

50
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,750
all it took to get tensorflow working in

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,060
pycharm and this leads nicely to the

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,979
next video where you can learn all about

53
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,590
using an IDE for step-by-step debugging

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,510

56
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,810
thank you
