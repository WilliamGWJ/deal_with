[Music]

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,509
hi everybody and welcome to the

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,219
tensorflow developer summit I'm Laurence

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,410
Moroney here in the tensorflow cafe and

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm chatting with Clemens me walls and

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,609
Clemens you work on tensor flow extended

7
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:16,359
or tf-x

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,980
yep could you tell us all about it seems

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,640
really cool yeah it is so G of X is an

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,900
end-to-end machine learning platform

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,700
that we built around tensor flow okay

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,840
what this really means is that

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,869
internally at Google a lot of developers

14
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:29,980
actually want to deploy tensor the

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,869
models in production okay and it's very

16
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:33,760
hard because in addition to the machine

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,079
learning piece you need many many more

18
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,940
pieces right intensive lextenda is

19
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,160
exactly this end-to-end machine learning

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,480
platform that takes care of all of this

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,220
because one of the things in your talk

22
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,600
that I really liked at the beginning of

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,860
the talk was like you have this machine

24
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,870
learning little box and you've got all

25
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,670
this stuff's around again that kind of

26
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,170
really hit home because it makes it real

27
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,780
yep so this is actually taken from a

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,149
paper from one of my colleagues

29
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,149
discovery and a couple of co-authors and

30
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,500
in this paper he was making this point

31
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,879
that machine learning systems are

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
extremely complex systems that if all of

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,560
these are the components and it's

34
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,840
extremely hard to integrate all of them

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,869
and make them work well together and it

36
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,400
there's actually a lot of technical debt

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,070
that is incurred by gluing things

38
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,010
together ad hoc okay so what we tried

39
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,630
with tf-x is actually to provide a

40
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,030
solution for this problem provide one

41
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,400
well integrated platform that had all of

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,530
these pieces integrated and it provided

43
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,299
an easy way for developers to use all of

44
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,280
these pieces end to end and get started

45
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,619
really fast Wow so there were a whole

46
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,810
bunch of things in the ecosystem but one

47
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,729
of them was like model analysis and I

48
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,470
know you've just published the blog post

49
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,090
on that could you could you tell us a

50
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,100
little bit about it yeah so model

51
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,810
analysis and we just open sources today

52
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,729
as tensor model analysis is

53
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,470
TFM a PF MA it just sounds perfect so

54
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,939
we've used this technology internally

55
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,400
for a while now and we use it for a

56
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,340
couple of purposes one of them really is

57
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,200
that once it's a tenth of the model is

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,930
trained you really want to find out how

59
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,240
it performs okay on your entire data set

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,030
on slices of that data set for subgroups

61
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,340
of your data and you will really want to

62
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,439
drill down into these metrics because in

63
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,809
some cases or in many cases people only

64
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,609
look at an aggregate quality metric and

65
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,520
that may tell you that the model works

66
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,010
well on average right but I ever H is

67
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,210
not always enough and there could be

68
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,710
some false positives and false negatives

69
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,540
hidden right exactly what you're doing

70
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,460
so a 10th of the modern analysis helps

71
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,070
with both computing this matrix or a

72
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,050
large amounts of data and also four

73
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,790
slices of those data and then we provide

74
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,670
some front-end tooling and interactive

75
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,680
components to drill down into these

76
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,500
metrics okay and find sub areas of data

77
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,640
where the model may not be performing

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,210
well or to find error cases or cases

79
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,550
where the model is actually not

80
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,410
performing as expected and then

81
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,910
developers can use this information to

82
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,280
either improve their model or go fix

83
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
their data if there's a mistake okay

84
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,940
sounds good so I'm sure a lot of the

85
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,980
time it is a it's a case of refactoring

86
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,240
your data to make it as efficient as

87
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,850
possible yes okay yeah so but this will

88
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,230
help you find that because otherwise

89
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,460
there's a lot of trial and error

90
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,530
exactly okay so cool now there's one of

91
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,000
the other things that I've seen in it is

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,280
a TF serving mm-hmm right and that's I

93
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,930
get a lot of questions from people like

94
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,820
you know how do I expose my model to the

95
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,990
world you know that kind of thing it's

96
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,340
like it's all very well if I have it on

97
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,200
my own machine and I can call it so how

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,480
does everything actually work so TF

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,580
serving it's very interesting the code

100
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,170
base that we actually open sourcing is

101
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,340
exactly the code base that we use

102
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,020
internally to serve our machine learning

103
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,420
models okay and the basic concept behind

104
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,030
it is that you don't want to hard-code

105
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,560
your machine learning model into an

106
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,630
application okay you would rather have a

107
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,820
server that loads a model and a new can

108
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,709
make requests to that server I think

109
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,900
which has a lot of benefits and tentacle

110
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,020
serving is exactly the solution that

111
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,550
that provides the community with this

112
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,590
technology and we just announced today

113
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,720
that we're working on a REST API okay

114
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
for the server because this is the

115
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,690
number one feature request from the

116
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,820
community and we've heard the community

117
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,860
and we're working very hard on releasing

118
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,540
this soon you read my mind cuz that's

119
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,980
exactly what's gonna ask what is the

120
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,260
interface is it a REST API like so you

121
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,490
know what is the interface today well

122
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,080
currently it's a it's chair PC

123
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,880
okay which works really well this is

124
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,800
what we use internally but obviously

125
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,480
like externally the standard in the

126
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,630
community and things that a lot of

127
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,090
developers asked us is for arrested yet

128
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,739
okay cool yeah I would love to see a

129
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,260
REST API ran this myself so I'll +1 that

130
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,720
boat perfect so now if I want to get

131
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
started with any of this stuff I'm a

132
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,570
developer and I really want to get into

133
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,190
tf-x and see what it gives me maybe

134
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,070
model analysis are serving or

135
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,110
any of the other tools where shall I go

136
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,450
to get started great question so there's

137
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,150
a there's a couple of components we've

138
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,760
already released namely transform model

139
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,290
analysis and serving okay

140
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,150
all of these are under the tensor flow

141
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,020
repo on github but most importantly when

142
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,090
we released model analysis today the

143
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,500
example that we released with model

144
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,140
analysis shows all of these and how they

145
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,940
use together nice and that's in your

146
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,650
covered in your blog post yes okay

147
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,240
that's being discussed in a blog post

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
and there's also a link where people can

149
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,810
actually go and follow that example to

150
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,520
see how to use all of these components

151
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,280
together our cool nice and then there's

152
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,380
more more components on the way exactly

153
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,810
as I pointed out in in in the dev summit

154
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,000
talk and this is only a very small part

155
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,190
of tf-x and we're working very hard to

156
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,190
release more to give this benefit to the

157
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,540
community and see what the community can

158
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,550
do with it okay Wow sounds good I have

159
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,840
to check it out what can I learn about

160
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,500
this again right now the best place is

161
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,790
really to start with that blog post on

162
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,620
intensive lament analysis okay and we

163
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,060
are actually working on a blog post

164
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,260
specifically for tf-x

165
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,210
in the Prada project sounds good and I

166
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,090
believe I'm working on that with you so

167
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,860
and so we'll put links to all of these

168
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,750
in the description below so you know for

169
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,550
people watching so thank you so much

170
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,440

171
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
and I hope that you have too it's been a

172
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,110
real pleasure having you on the show
